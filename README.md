## Description 

This is a website project that I was asked by a client to mirror. It contains a home/about page, contact page and portoflio page.




## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

Copy all html pages to site root as well as assets folder with images and css folder

This is very basic. an end user will navigate to the various pages and click on the image thumbnails on the portfolio page.
